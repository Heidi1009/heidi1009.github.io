An R package to estimate different types of cluster robust standard errors (CR0, CR1, CR2) with degrees of freedom adjustments. Standard errors are computed based on [Liang and Zeger (1986)](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/73.1.13) and [Bell and McCaffrey (2002)](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/pub/12-001-x/2002002/article/9058-eng.pdf?st=NxMjN1YZ). Functions used in [Huang and Li (2022)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01627-0), [Huang, Wiedermann, and Zhang (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00273171.2022.2077290), and [Huang, Zhang, and Li (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/19345747.2022.2100301).
