The majority of causal discovery methods, however, relies on the assumption of causal effect homogeneity, that is, the identified causal structure is expected to hold for the entire population. Because causal mechanisms can vary across subpopulations, we propose combining methods of model-based recursive partitioning and non-Gaussian causal discovery to identify such subpopulations. The resulting algorithm can discover subpopulations with potentially varying magnitude and causal direction of effects under mild parameter inequality assumptions. Feasibility conditions are described and results from synthetic data experiments are presented suggesting that large effects and large sample sizes are beneficial for detecting causally competing subgroups with acceptable statistical performance. In a real-world data example, the extraction of meaningful subgroups that differ in the causal mechanism underlying the development of numerical cognition is illustrated. Potential extensions and recommendations for best practice applications are discussed.","tags":null,"title":"Detecting Heterogeneity in the Causal Direction of Dependence: A Model-Based Recursive Partitioning Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B Zhang","W Wiedermann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1691107200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691107200,"objectID":"4075897c122cff0370e7dbc9878f5957","permalink":"https://bzedpsy.github.io/publication/zhang-ww-2023/","publishdate":"2023-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-ww-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding causal mechanisms is a central goal in the behavioral, developmental, and social sciences. When estimating and probing causal effects using observational data, covariate adjustment is a crucial element to remove dependencies between focal predictors and the error term. Covariate selection, however, constitutes a challenging task because availability alone is not an adequate criterion to decide whether a covariate should be included in the statistical model. The present study introduces a non-Gaussian method for covariate selection and provides a forward selection algorithm for linear models (i.e., non-Gaussian Forward Selection; nGFS) to select appropriate covariates from a set of potential control variables to avoid inconsistent and biased estimators of the causal effect of interest. Further, we demonstrate that the forward selection algorithm has properties compatible with principles of direction of dependence, i.e., probing whether the causal target model is correctly specified with respect to the causal direction of effects. Results of a Monte-Carlo simulation study suggest that the selection algorithm performs well, in particular, when sample sizes are large (i.e., n ≥ 250), and data strongly deviate from Gaussianity (e.g., distributions with skewnesses beyond 1.5). An empirical example is given for illustrative purposes.","tags":null,"title":"Covariate Selection in Causal Learning under Non-Gaussianity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["FL Huang","B Zhang","WM Reinke","KC Herman","J Sebastian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1678060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678060800,"objectID":"709753e7c12e5bb1ce4c49a3ed0fe54f","permalink":"https://bzedpsy.github.io/publication/huang-et-al-2023/","publishdate":"2023-03-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/huang-et-al-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Although several studies have focused on why school climate is important, the timing of the collection of climate measures should be considered.

Findings are based on data from 26 secondary schools (using over 20,000 student responses) that had school climate measures taken in fall and spring over 18 months.

In addition to studying \"average treatment effects\", the evaluation of \"distributional treatment effects\", (i.e., effects that go beyond means), has been suggested to obtain a broader picture of how an intervention affects the study outcome. We continue this discussion by considering distributional causal effects. We present formal definitions of causal effects that go beyond means and utilize a distributional regression framework known as generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS). GAMLSS allows one to characterize an intervention effect in its totality through simultaneously modeling means, variances, skewnesses, kurtoses, as well as ceiling and floor effects of outcome distributions. Based on data from a large-scale randomized controlled trial, we use GAMLSS to evaluate the impact of a teacher classroom management program on student academic performance. Results suggest the teacher classroom management training increased mean academic competence as well as the chance to obtain the maximum score on the academic competence scale. These effects would have been completely overlooked in a traditional evaluation of mean aggregates.","tags":null,"title":"Distributional Causal Effects: Beyond an “Averagarian” View of Intervention Effects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y-R Chuang","FL Huang","KC Herman","B Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"a613234fe928a2847cfde618684d46e1","permalink":"https://bzedpsy.github.io/publication/chuang-et-al-2022/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chuang-et-al-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Positive perceptions of school climate are associated with improved academic and behavioral outcomes, such as lower bullying victimization experience and higher student engagement. The present study evaluated the consistency of these relations across racial/ethnic student groups using the Authoritative School Climate (ASC) model which defines school climate as a 3-factor model including disciplinary structure, student support, and academic expectations. Data were collected from 5,878 middle/high school students from Missouri and Oklahoma. School-level fixed effects model revealed more negative perception of school climate and higher peer victimization experiences (i.e., general or bullying) amongst racially minoritized groups. Minoritized Racial Identity also negatively moderated the effect between perception of school climate and the selected outcomes with a small to medium effect.

However, CRSEs can be problematic when the number of clusters is low (e.g., \u003c 50) and, with CRTs, a low number of clusters is quite common. We investigate the use of the CR2 CRSE and an empirical degrees of freedom adjustment (dofBM) proposed by Bell and McCaffrey with a simulation using binary outcomes and illustrate its use with an applied example. Findings show that the CR2 (w/dofBM) standard errors are relatively unbiased with coverage and power rates for group-level predictors that are comparable to that of a multilevel logistic regression model and can be used even with as few as 10 clusters. To promote its use, a free graphical SPSS extension is provided that can fit logistic (and linear) regression models with a variety of CRSEs and dof adjustments.","tags":null,"title":"Using Robust Standard Errors for the Analysis of Binary Outcomes with a Small Number of Clusters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["FL Huang","W Wiedermann","B Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654819200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654819200,"objectID":"4947dca2bb28d4f7ee57f5f53a28f675","permalink":"https://bzedpsy.github.io/publication/huang-et-al-2022-2/","publishdate":"2022-06-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/huang-et-al-2022-2/","section":"publication","summary":"Homogeneity of variance (HOV) is a well-known but often untested assumption in the context of multilevel models (MLMs). However, depending on how large the violation is, how different group sizes are, and the variance pairing, standard errors can be over or underestimated even when using MLMs, resulting in questionable inferential tests. We evaluate several tests (e.g., the H statistic, Breusch Pagan, Levene’s test) that can be used with MLMs to assess violations of HOV. Although the traditional robust standard errors used with MLMs require at least 50 clusters to be effective, we assess a robust standard error adjustment (i.e., the CR2 estimator) that can be used even with a few clusters. Findings are assessed using a Monte Carlo simulation and are further illustrated using an applied example. We show that explicitly modeling the heterogenous variance structures or using the CR2 estimator are both effective at ameliorating the issues associated with the fixed effects of the regression model related to violations of HOV resulting from between-group differences.","tags":null,"title":"Accounting for Heteroskedasticity Resulting from Between-Group Differences in Multilevel Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B Zhang","Z Deng","H Zhang","Y Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1641427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641427200,"objectID":"b892bd0705bef879307beebe79840c01","permalink":"https://bzedpsy.github.io/publication/zhang-et-al-2022/","publishdate":"2022-01-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-et-al-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"This study investigated whether familiarity and expertise of a dissenter would lessen the trust of a three-person majority among preschoolers in a Chinese sample.

However, when familiarity and expertise of the dissenter were manipulated in the experiments, the majority was less endorsed by both age groups than the previous condition. Furthermore, the preference for the majority under conflicting conditions depended on age. Especially, five-year-olds trusted the expert more than the majority, and they trusted the majority more than the familiar person. However, three-year-olds did not show any significant preference. These results suggest that older preschoolers tend to value other factors rather than simply accepting the information shared among a majority.
